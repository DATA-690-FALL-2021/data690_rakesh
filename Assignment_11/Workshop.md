- Data-690-Fall-2021
- Student- Rakesh
- Professor- Dr.Wang
- Platform- https://ce.ezanalytix.com/
### Things learned during the workshop.
- First learned about the data exporting into the https://ce.ezanalytix.com/ platform, and it has very simple option of drag and drop which is very convenient and time saving.
- This tool has inbuilt functions for data analysis part and there is no need of any coding for data analysis, so without having any coding knowledge anybody can analyze the data with following simple steps.
- Data stratification process can be very quick and easy with this tool.
- This tool has in-built data processing steps like Data joining, modifying records, modifying variables and validation rules.
- With using Data joining step we can join different datasets to existing dataset easily at any point, and can see the original dataset, joined dataset and final merged datset separately in the workflow tab.
- This tool gives us option of modifying the current working record at any point of time and at the same time we can even modify the variable and it's type with simple steps.
- This tool has different validation scenarios like Single field validation, Multi filed validation..etc.
- This tool has different range of methods for analysis like One Sample Distribution Test, Regression Analysis, Multivariate Analysis, Time Series Analysis...etc. And each of these analysis again have different subset of analysis according to our requirement and kind of dataset we have we can choose the appropriate method for our analysis. and it gives us lot of flexibility while choosing the methods and biggest part is no need of importing libraries and no-coding requirement.
- This tool has options of selecting different graphs like histogram, pie-chart..etc during analysis phase and we can download these graphs very easily.
- And once we finish all the operations with one click we can download the entire report in word document which is very convenient for data-reporting purposes. it gives very detailed report about each and every step involved in the analysis part.
- Finally Explored the different tabs/keys in the ezanalytix tool platform and understood their functions for data analysis perspective. and I really enjoyed exploring this platform, and without having any coding background anybody can easily adapt this tool for data analysis purposes.
